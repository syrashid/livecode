    # Shorthand for Array of symbols:

  # In Ruby, most objects RESPOND to a .to_s call.
  # However, if you do not override the implementation
  # of this method, converting an instance of Meal
  # to String would look like this:
  #
  # #<Meal:0x00007ff4be01dc08>
  #
  # We want to teach our model to display its data as
  # a string so that we can use it in the View
  # The selves are unnnecessary, but I've put them in for
  # clarification that they are methods and not local variables
