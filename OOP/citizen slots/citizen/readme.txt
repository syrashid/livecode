>> CONTEXT <<

Implement a Citizen class with the following API / Contract:

#initialize(first_name, last_name, age)
#can_vote? (boolean)
#full_name (String)

>> PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH <<
- What are the expected inputs and outputs?
- Psuedocoding >> Tests >> Coding

>> TESTING <<
Let's think how testing changes for a class vs just a simple function

>> IMPORTANT TOPICS FOR SY TO COVER <<
- How tests differ for functions and classes (new level of describe)
- Diff between a function and a method
- Diff between an argument and a parameter
- Edge cases (assume stupidity and account for as much as possible)
- Conventions for naming class vs file name
- Public vs private, concepts of a contract

>> WHAT WE HAVE <<
- Nothing... well almost nothing, I give you the spec structure
