SQLite Task Manager
Letâ€™s build a Task class capable of CRUD against a SQL table tasks.

You are given a tasks.db database with one task (id = 1), a task.rb file to complete and a test.rb to test your code.

Before we start, let's make sure we have a strong understanding.  What is the input, and what is the output?

X Implement the READ logic to find a given task (by its id)
X Implement the CREATE logic in a save instance method
X Implement the UPDATE logic in the same method
X Implement the READ logic to retrieve all tasks (what type of method is it?)
X Implement the DESTROY logic on a task


Talking Points
- Iterative approach to problem saving
- In our MVC Model, what is the DB synonomous to?
- Why do we pass parameters when we interact with our DB, what are we trying to prevent?
- Difference between .new and .save
- What is the role of save to do here (two components)
