SQLite Task Manager
Letâ€™s build a Task class capable of CRUD against a SQL table tasks.

You are given a tasks.db database with one task (id = 1), a task.rb file to complete and a test.rb to test your code.

Before we start, let's make sure we have a strong understanding.  What is the input, and what is the output?

 x Implement the READ logic to find a given task (by its id)
 x Implement the CREATE logic in a save instance method
 x Implement the UPDATE logic in the same method
 x Implement the READ logic to retrieve all tasks (what type of method is it?)
 Implement the DESTROY logic on a task
 Walk thru of what's been given so far


Talking Points (MAKE SURE SY COVERS THESE)
- Iterative approach to problem saving
- Using your debugging tools
- Principles of refactoring (proof of concept, improve performance, proof of beauty)
- TDD (refresher)
- In our MVC Model, what is the DB synonomous to?
- Why do we sanitize parameters when we interact with our DB, what are we trying to prevent?
- Difference between .new and .save
- What is the role of save to do here (two components)
- How AR works in the backend (if time permits)
