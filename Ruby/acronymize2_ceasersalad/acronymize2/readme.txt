>> CONTEXT <<<

As an older brother I really have two roles in life.  The first is to safe guard my sister from any hurt in the world.  The second is to mercilessly annoy and prank her.  It's quite the juxtaposition.

Well last night I heard you guys built an acronymize method and I figured it could be really funny to use it to teach my mom different acronyms that my sister is using.  Ideally we end up with a situation like this:

<< Pull Up Image

But we don't want to use it the same way we did before, let's refactor it using one of the handy dandy iterators we learned about today

>> IMPORTANT TOPICS FOR SY TO COVER <<
1) Introduction to rspec
2) Method chaining
3) Too much refactoring
4) How rspec needs to be structured
5) 2 families of iterators (do something, return something)


>> WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE <<
1) old code from yesterday
2) a good sense of mischief
