To make things a bit faster we've decided to go with the following, so we can get some materials set up beforehand:

Our primary takeways today will be the following:

1) Understanding proper css organization
2) The importance of drawing/diagraming precode
3) General coding order from drawing > CSS

Important things for Sy to cover, make sure he talks to all of these

1) Relative vs absolute positioning
2) Understanding Shadows
3) Importance of font choices
  -No more than 2, use 1 if questioning
  -Contrast (serif/san serif)
4) Importance of font sizing
  -Follow rules of visual heirarchy
5) Playing with hover effects + transitions
6) Flex + Layouts in general
7) Refactoring lessons for CSS
8) Design choices in terms of UX
9) Mechanism of media queries

So without further ado, let's jump into this bad boy.

First off, let's quickly talk through some of the things that have already been done.
  -index.html
  -css structure
  -css components

Before we ever start to code what is the first thing we should do?

Great now that we've "psuedocoded/drawn" what is the next step?

Finally, what should be the last thing we do?

But, actually what should be the last thing we do?
