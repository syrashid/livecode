Welcome to the Animal Kingdom everyone

Today's challenge is going to push the boundries of what we've learned and illuminate some of the concepts you've been using all day!

Flow
- Review objective with the class (what are we doing?)
- Some of the tools you reckon we'll use today



- Psuedocode (How are we doing this?)
  -- create an animal class, make sure it can be read from for certain properties
  -- creating three classes, inherits all from animal
  -- implement a talk method for each animal
  -- In another Ruby file, create an array with Simba, Nala, Timon & Pumbaa, iterate over it and puts the sound each animal make
  --implement a ::phyla class method
  --implement an eat method for all animals, and override for the lion





- Let's write the tests (Criterions for success), oh wait
- Write the animal class, and all the children
- Build the interface to watch it work (Why is this separate?)
- Do the class method phyla
- Method overriding with inheritance

Vital Topics to Cover
- Read the documentation
- Ruby make / Rake
- Using rubocop individually
- Using self to create class methods vs instance methods
- Refactoring Code principles & Super
- Ruby matchers (ex: exist, be, be_a, be_an, eq)
- Separation of concerns
